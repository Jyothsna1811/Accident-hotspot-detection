# Accident-hotspot-detection
Traffic Accident  Prediction is an intelligent system that identifies high-risk road segments using geospatial road network data. Roads are modeled as a graph with intersections as nodes and roads as edges. Using GATV2, the system learns spatial patterns and generates risk scores to highlight accident-prone locations for improved road safety.
